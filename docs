## Problem Statement

A company wants to analyze employee performance based on evaluation scores. The HR team needs a PL/SQL-based system that:
- Stores employee details.
- Calculates grades based on scores.
- Identifies top and low performers.
- Handles invalid data using GOTO statements.

This program demonstrates **Collections**, **Records**, and **GOTO statements** in PL/SQL.
